# OpenSaber
An open-source DIY lightsaber. Very work-in-progress.

## How to make your own

#### Materials needed:

- Arduino Uno -w- USB Cable
- WS2812 LED strip - these can be found on Amazon for cheap
- A device capable of running the Arduino IDE
- Lightsaber enclosure - I gutted a cheap dollar store lightsaber and used the parts for this one


#### Assembly:

- Connect the 5V pin on the LED strip to the 5V power port on your Arduino
- Connect the GND pin on the LED strip to any GND port on your Arduino
- Connect the remaining data port to **digital output port 5** on your Arduino
- Fit your components into your enclosure
- Upload the sketch to your Arduino using the Arduino IDE 
- Enjoy!
